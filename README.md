# LittleProjects
Github this is my little projects Repo. 


My own Repository of iOS knowledge and workarounds. My repo of good and bad implementations.
My own repo of BAD little buggy projects.
It's like a bag of marbles to play in the future and in not so many years, will be the way I'll be digging 
and saying, What the fuck I intended to wrote in here.
